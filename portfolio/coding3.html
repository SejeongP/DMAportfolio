      2023 Coding 3
       <br>Mediums used: Visual Studio Code<br><br>
      <h1>
Based on the algorithm created by p5, 
            <a href="https://p5js.org/examples/math-parametric-equations.html">Parametric Equations</a>
        , I manipulated the original code by adding my own methods that embrace a sense of three-dimensional environment. I applied the concept of bounce in order to make the lines on the code move around the canvas. Additionally using the framecount function, I made the colors intensify at certain number of frames. For example, when the frameCount is at 80, another line appears and overlaps with the intial line, making the color intensified.
        
        <br><br>

         
        
        In my paint program, the users can paint their own version of their dream world, filled with pastel and rainbow colors. From the random color pen to the realistic cloud stamp, you can paint, draw, and experiment for fun with the colors and shapes that are randomly created by the system.
Something that was successful in my project, I believe, was making brushes that differ from one another and adding a cohesive theme behind them. Creating the project conceptually was especially fun for me because, although it was harder to think of elements as a whole in the big picture, It felt rewarding to see how I incorporated the concepts I learned and used them the way I wanted to present them in a more visually appealing way.
Things that could be improved are just creating brushes that are unexpectedly interesting and adding toggle logic to make it more interactive. I believe there could have been other brush effects that were cohesive with my theme with the use of toggle logic.
